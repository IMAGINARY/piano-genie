# Piano Genie

Adaptation of the Piano Genie web demo for use in the I AM AI exhibition website.

Have some fun pretending you're a piano virtuoso using machine learning!

Use the **1-8** numbered keys on your keyboard (or the home row **a-f** and **j-;**) or 
**touch** the coloured blocks to play the piano. Use the **space bar** to control the 
sustain pedal. 

The more you pretend you're a real player, the better the melody (and you!) will sound.
