    <p>Have some fun pretending you're a piano virtuoso using machine learning!</p>
    <p>Use the <b>1-8</b> numbered keys on your keyboard (or the home row <b>a-f</b> and <b>j-;</b>) or <b>touch</b> the
      coloured blocks to play the piano. Use the <b>space bar</b> to control the sustain pedal. The more
      you pretend you're a real player, the better the melody (and you!) will sound.
